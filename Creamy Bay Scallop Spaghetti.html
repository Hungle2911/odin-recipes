    <h1>Creamy Bay Scallop Spaghetti</h1>

    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>This scallop pasta dinner with a creamy sauce is fast and easy. I cook the scallops a bit longer than many chefs, but that gives the dish more flavor and they're still tender and moist. I think you'll agree, the sherry sauce benefits significantly from the longer cook time.</p>

    <h4><u>How to make</u></h4>
    <ol>
        <li class="inline">Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, about 10 minutes or 1 minute less than directed on the package.</li>
        <li class="inline">Meanwhile, heat oil in a large skillet over high heat. When oil just starts to smoke, add scallops and move them into a single layer. Let sear on high for about 1 minute. Toss to turn.</li>
        <li class="inline">Add butter and stir scallops until butter melts. Stir in garlic</li>
        <li class="inline">Add lemon zest and red pepper flakes. Stir in sherry and cook and stir until alcohol cooks off, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li class="inline">Pour in cream. When mixture begins to simmer, reduce heat to medium-low. Add salt, pepper, and lemon juice.</li>
        <li class="inline">Drain pasta. Transfer to skillet with scallops; bring to a simmer. Add 1/2 of the chopped parsley. Cook until pasta is heated through and tender, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li class="inline">Remove from heat. Garnish generously with grated cheese. Add the rest of the parsley. Serve in warm bowls.</li>
